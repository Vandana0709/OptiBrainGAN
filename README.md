# OptiBrainGAN
A project on Alzheimer's stage classification using GANs and metaheuristic-optimized deep learning.

-This project proposes a hybrid deep learning framework, OptiBrainGAN, that integrates GAN-generated synthetic MRI data with metaheuristic-optimized models for Alzheimer’s stage classification. It addresses major challenges in medical imaging like data scarcity, feature redundancy, and model inefficiency.

#DATASET
The dataset used in this project is from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can request access from the official ADNI website.
